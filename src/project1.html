                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Land segmentation from aerial imagery is a challenging problem in remote sensing and computer
                    vision, requiring accurate classification of different land use types such as water, land, roads,
                    buildings, and vegetation. In this project, I explored three different models — a U-Net neural
                    network, a Logistic Regression model, and a Random Forest Classifier — for segmenting land use from
                    aerial images. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle, consisting of labeled aerial images for
                    semantic segmentation tasks. The objective was to evaluate the performance of deep learning against
                    traditional machine learning models for this classification problem.

                <h3>Data Preparation and Preprocessing</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The dataset consisted of high-resolution aerial images, each paired with a corresponding mask image
                    that denotes different land use types using color codes. To make the data suitable for training the
                    models, the following steps were performed: image resizing, data augmentation, class balancing, and
                    mask conversion.

                <h3>Model Development and Training</h3>
                <h4>U-Net Model</h4>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The U-Net architecture is widely used for semantic segmentation tasks in deep learning. In this
                    project, the U-Net model was trained using a custom loss function — Categorical Focal Loss — which
                    focuses on difficult-to-classify pixels. The model was optimized using the Adam optimizer and
                    trained for 50 epochs on a GPU to leverage accelerated computing power.

                <h4>Logistic Regression Model</h4>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary
                    classification tasks. For the purpose of pixel-wise multi-class classification in this project, the
                    RGB values of each pixel were used as features, and the corresponding class label was the target
                    variable.
                </p>

                <h4>Random Forest Classifier</h4>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training
                    and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks. Similar to the Logistic Regression
                    model, the Random Forest Classifier was trained using pixel data.
                </p>

                <h3>Results and Performance Comparison</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    The performance of the three models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
                    metrics. The U-Net model, owing to its deep learning architecture, excelled in capturing complex
                    spatial dependencies and provided the highest overall accuracy. However, the Logistic Regression and
                    Random Forest models, while computationally less expensive, also delivered respectable results for
                    simpler segmentation tasks.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    This project successfully demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of both deep learning
                    (U-Net) and traditional machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) methods for land
                    segmentation classification. While the U-Net model provided superior accuracy, the machine learning
                    models offered simpler and faster alternatives with reasonable performance.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                    Future directions for this project could include experimenting with more advanced deep learning
                    models like DeepLabV3+ or incorporating transfer learning techniques.
